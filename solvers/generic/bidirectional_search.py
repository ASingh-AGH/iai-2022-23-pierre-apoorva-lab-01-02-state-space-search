class SearchProcess():
    """
    A single search process in the bidirectional approach.

    Attributes:
    ===========
    problem: Problem
        solved problem, passed in the constructor
    start_state: State
        state where the process starts the search
        passed in the constructor
    heuristic: Heuristic
        heuristic used to guide the search
        passed in the constructor
    tree: Tree
        search tree associated with the search
        set up in the __init__
    frontier: PriorityQueue
        a queue with nodes left to be explored
        set up in the __init__
    meeting_point: Optional[Node]
        current best node shared with the opposing search process
        set up in the __init__
    cost_lower_bound: float
        the current lower bound on the solutions
    rejected_states: Set[State]
        set containing all the nodes that don't have to be explored
    scanned_states: Set[State]
        set containing all the nodes that have been expanded
    labeled_states: Dict[State, Node]
        this dictionary contains all the nodes that wait to be expanded
        one access the node by the corresponding state

    Methods:
    ========
    labeled_node(state: State) -> Optional[Node]
        returns labeled node assiociated with the given state
        returns None, if there is no such node
    labeled_state_cost(state: State) -> float
        if the state is labeled, return an associated cost
        otherwise returns +inf
    has_labeled_state(state: State) -> bool
        returns whether the state has been labeled
    has_scanned_state(state: State) -> bool:
        returns whether the state has been scanned
    expand_frontier(upper_bound: float, opposite: SearchProcess) -> Optional[float]
        performs a single step of the search process, i.e. expands single viable node from the frontier
        uses current upper bound and info from opposite search to prune the search tree
        returns None if there are no more nodes to be expanded
        otherwise returns updated upper bound
